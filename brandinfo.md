brand information

Brothers Cash&Carry is one of the projects by “United Brothers AB”. United Brothers AB is a family owned company which started its business in 2014 by opening its first shop with the name of “Asian Afrikan Supermarket” in Märsta. This little shop became famous in no time despite having little variety of Asian, African and Latin-American food products only because of its best prices and top quality customer services. First successful year in the market encouraged us to increase the variety of products and by the end of 2015 we started our own import from other countries and today this little shop is overwhelmingly filled with products across the world.

The journey of success continues and by the passage of time that little shop was not enough for the variety of products we deal in so we decided to start opening more shops and in the year 2018 we opened our second and relatively bigger shop in Upplands Väsby with the name of “Väsby Matcenter”. There we offer more variety and even food from Middle East as well, so it is a shop which offers you real diversity in food from around the world.

Today we provide you fresh vegetables, spices, beans, lentils, peas, rice, flour, oil, frozen stuff, ready to eat stuff, cosmetics etc from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Srilanka, Thailand, Phillipines, Uganda, Nigeria, Middle East and Latin-America just to name a few out of many countries at the best prices since our slogan is “quality @ affordability”.

This story of success doesn’t finish here, instead it gives us a fresh start to an endless journey of success in today’s digital world and we launch our first online grocery store “cashncarry.se” where you can find quality products from Asia, Africa, Latin-America and Middle East at even better price. Our mission is to provide you with the best of your home taste at affordable prices.
